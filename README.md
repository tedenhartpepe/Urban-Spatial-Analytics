# Urban-Spatial-Analytics
University of Pennsylvania
Urban Spatial Analytics includes select projects from an Urban Spatial Analysis course at the University of Pennsylvania.
The course focused on advanced GIS functionality and spatial analysis in the urban planning domain, and helped me to 
develop introductory statistics skills and a framework for understanding how to efficiently allocate limited resources across 
space. Select projects highlight network analysis, retail site-suitability, spatial housing market analysis, 
predictive modeling, remote sensing, and land use planning.
